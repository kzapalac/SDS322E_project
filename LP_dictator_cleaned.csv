People come into your life for a reason, and they leave for a reason as well. Their impact makes a difference in your life and that can be a great thing. But it is important not to get stuck on one person. If that person has left your life then it is for a reason, maybe it is so that you can see or experience something even better than before.

Although I don't have kids of my own, I'm in a committed relationship with a woman who has 3 kids and I am engaged to marry this woman this year. For most of my life I have worked as a corporate salesman for a technology company, but when I started getting involved with the woman I love I decided to go back to school and get a law degree. I achieved this goal and will be an attorney as soon as I pass the bar exam. In the meantime, I've been working as a legal assistant at a small law firm. I'm learning how a small law fir works in the hopes that I can create a firm of my own. I'm doing this so I have financial stability for my family. In my previous career, I had some amount of success, but I also feared I could be fired if I didn't meet quotas, which was very stressful. As far as something interesting that has happened in my life recently, my fiance bought me a motorcycle as a gift for my graduating from law school, and I road it across the country to visit my brother's family. I was a great break after 3 years of studying. ","The time when I met someone new that first comes to mind was when I met this woman my fiance knows who had just spent two years in prison. She was from a very different background than me. She had been basically on the streets and hooked on drugs since she was 16 years old, and when I met her she was nearly 30. She had been in and out of the criminal justice system for many years. My fiance assured me she was a good person at heart and told me about some awful things that had happened to her that caused her problems in life. When I got to know her I found she was actually a person with a very good heart.  /  / Getting to know this person exposed me to a very different social class. I found that I could fit in with very different types of people. The way that this extended my mastery of social situations was that  it helped me learn how to interact with people where there is a cultural divide. At the end of the day, people are people, and if you get past your prejudices you will find you can get along well with people of all backgrounds.

I'm proud of this because I'm the first one in my family to get to go to college, and extremely grateful for the opportunity.

I didn't know what to do, because I've never been very good at understanding and interacting with children, but I wanted to try.
