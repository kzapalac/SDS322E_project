# SDS322E final project
This repository contains all the elements of the final project for the class Elements of Data Science, SDS 322E. The project was a group effort by Kaylee Billstone, Paulina Brown, Jaqueline Marroquin, Christiana Ozuna, Kirsten Richards, and Kennedy Zapalac.

In this project, we explored how in-group bias can be influenced by priming people with a learning versus performance orientation.

If you would like to learn more about our project, I recommend reading through our **FinalProjectReport.pdf**.

Here is a brief description of all the important files above:
- **LP_Dictator.csv**: survey data from before it was cleaned.
- **LP_Dictator.pdf**: outline of the survey given to participants
- **dataCleaning.Rmd**: R code used to clean the data
- **dataCleaning.html**: Knit version of dataCleaning.Rmd, walking through the data cleaning performed
- **dataCleaning.pdf**: Same as above but PDF form
- **LP_dictator_cleaned.csv**: Final dataset used to conduct EDA and modeling
- **EDA.Rmd**: performed EDA to formulate initial hypotheses. All graphs in the final report came from this document, aside from the word cloud, which came from the dataCleaning.Rmd
- **EDA.html**: knit version of the EDA in html format
- - **EDA.html**: knit version of the EDA in PDF format
- **Modeling.ipynb**: python code used to perform classification tasks using logistic regression
- **Presentation.pptx**: powerpoint presentation given to class
- **FinalProjectReport.pdf**: final product from this project which explains the aims, data source, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and results
